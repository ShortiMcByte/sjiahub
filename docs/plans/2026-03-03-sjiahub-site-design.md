## Purpose

A resource hub for families, educators, and the broader public navigating systemic juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). The site serves three primary goals:

1. Educate visitors about sJIA (what it is, symptoms, diagnosis, flares, treatment)
2. Promote the pre-publication children's book *Corbin and the Helpers Inside His Body*
3. Curate resources (medical orgs, advocacy groups, school tools, anti-inflammatory diet)

---

## Audience

- Parents of children with sJIA (primary)
- Educators, school staff, classmates
- Medical professionals (many have limited sJIA exposure due to its rarity)
- General public / broad awareness
